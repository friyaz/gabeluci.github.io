message: "You can just use a `static` [`HashSet<string>`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.hashset-1) and add the domains the first time you find them. A `HashSet` is better than `List` since it will prevent duplicates.\r\nIf you have trouble with it, post what you've come up with on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) some someone will be able to help you."
