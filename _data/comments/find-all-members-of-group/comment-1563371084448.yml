  That's what my examples above return: the "DOMAIN\Username". It does so by
  getting the
  [`msDS-PrincipalName`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/808ac90e-e80d-4ce4-ad24-cb462dd06820).
  That's a constructed attribute, meaning that it is calculated at the time you
  ask for it. But that also means you can't use it as a filter in a search.
