  One little notice here. I assume that GetGroupMemberList method will end with
  stackoverflow if I have GroupA as a member of GroupB and GroupB as a member of
  GroupA. A simple HashSet solution won't work here as users of GroupA are
  members of GroupB and users of GroupB are members of GroupA as well )
