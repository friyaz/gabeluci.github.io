  Hey, Gabriel. Just read your articles about Active Directory performance and
  membership and would like to say, that you're doing a great job. Keep going!
  One little thing I would like to share with you regarding performance is
  connection caching. See:
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/adsi/connection-caching. In
  terms of C# it means that we need to create and maintain a DirectoryEntry for
  every domain controller we connect to for all the time period we make LDAP
  queries to this DC. Singleton required here: every new created DirectoryEntry
  instance will reuse opened LDAP connection under the hood. This solves two
  problems. 1. All LDAP request will (almost always) share one single
  connection, and performance will go through the roof. 2. DoS. A domain
  controller applies a throttling policy to LDAP requests. Creating numerous
  LDAP connections from one computer (even if they are properly disposed) will
  trigger the policy and at some point we will be unable to connect to the DC
